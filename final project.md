# Data Science 

## Introduction
```
Data science languages are programming languages designed specifically for data analysis, manipulation, visualization, and machine learning activities. They give the tools and frameworks needed to handle big datasets, execute sophisticated computations, and even build predictive models.

## Arithmetic Expressions

An arithmetic expression is an expression built up using numbers, arithmetic operators (such as +, , -, / and ) and parentheses, "(" and ")".    Arithmetic expressions may also make use of exponents, for example, writing  23as an abreviation for ((22)2).

An arithmetic expression in which the only operators are +,, - and exponentiation, is called a simple arithmetic expression. Here are some examples:

5 --  a number is an arithmetic expression
(3 + 4) -- the  sum of numbers is an arithmetic expression
(7 - 3) --  the difference  of two  numbers is an arithmetic expression


## Multiply and add numbers
```
# Multiplication
product = 7 * 3
print("The product of 7 and 3 is:", product)

# Addition
sum = 5 + 9
print("The sum of 5 and 9 is:", sum)
```

## convert minutes to hours
```
minutes = 120

hours = minutes / 60

print(f"{minutes} minutes is equal to {hours} hours.")

```
